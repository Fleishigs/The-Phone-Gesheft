                    <h3>What is a browser-free phone?</h3>
                    <p>A browser-free phone is a smartphone that has had its web browser and other distracting apps removed or disabled. This allows you to use essential features like calls, texts, maps, and approved apps while avoiding the endless scrolling and time-wasting that comes with unrestricted internet access.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why would I want a phone without a browser?</h3>
                    <p>Many people find that unlimited internet access on their phone leads to decreased productivity, poor sleep, anxiety, and less meaningful real-world connections. A browser-free phone helps you stay connected to what matters while eliminating digital distractions. It's perfect for students, professionals, parents, and anyone seeking a healthier relationship with technology.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
